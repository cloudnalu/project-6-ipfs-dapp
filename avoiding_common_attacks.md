I avoided several common security attacks by using the well-documented and verifiably-secure contract libraries from Open Zeppelin. Specifically, I imported the Pull Payment contract, and the Ownable Contract. Using these contracts helped me code more efficiently and also guard against common attacks such as the reentrancy attack and also allows me, the deployer some special functionality as an owner, such as temporarily disabling functions with the circuit breaker function, or self destructing the contract in an emergency.
