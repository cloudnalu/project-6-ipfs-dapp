README

This is a dapp for buyers and sellers of an image asset. 

Buyer user story: 
	A Buyer can connect to the app, view items available for sale, and purchase items. Their purchased items are then displayed in their purchased items history. 

Seller user story: 
	A Seller can connect to the app, define a price for an item, and upload an image of the item. When an item is sold, it is held in escrow, until the Seller checks for payments and withdraws them using the buttons. 

The admin of the app can connect and use the Open/Close store button to toggle the purchasing function on or off. 

The image files are stored with IPFS (Interplanetary File System). 
The project is deployed on the Rinkeby testnet. 
The front-end web application may be hosted on localhost:3000. 

To run the project:

Dependencies:
Node (I used v14.9.0)
Ganache
